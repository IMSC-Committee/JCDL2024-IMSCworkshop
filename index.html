    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in the <b>2nd Workshop on Innovation Measurement for Scientific Communication (IMSC) in the Era of Big Data</b>, to be held as part of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2024, Hong Kong, Dec 20th, 2024 (<a href=" https://2024.jcdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCDL2024</a>).
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose of the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The increasingly mature artificial intelligence technologies, such as big data, deep learning, and natural language processing, provide technical support for research on automatic text understanding and bring development opportunities for innovative measurement of scientific communication. Innovation measurement in scientific communication is a challenging and cutting-edge direction in Informetrics. It is interdisciplinary, requiring considering the characteristics of different disciplines and different types of scientific outcomes to establish a comprehensive evaluation metrics system. On the other hand, metadata and content features should be considered to reflect the innovation of scientific works objectively and comprehensively. This workshop focuses on the discussion and produces enlightening outcomes. We will engage broad audiences to share their ideas and pre-productions, enabling an interdisciplinary approach to exploring frontier areas. This workshop consists of keynotes, oral presentations, and poster sessions and would attract interest from academic researchers, librarians, and decision-makers from governments and practical sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
	Scientific innovation and breakthroughs are the primary driving forces behind technological advancement. Measuring and tracking these innovative studies is a crucial direction in informetrics and the Science of Science. In the era of big data, the development of informatics presents both opportunities and challenges. Although a large number of papers are published, the scarcity of truly innovative publications makes their automatic identification and tracking significantly difficult. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing and knowledge reasoning, offer potential solutions. As stated in the Leiden Manifesto [2], quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been proposed to measure the innovativeness of knowledge in science communication. For example, Wang et al. using coarse feature and knowledge entity network to evaluate scientific papers quality [7]. Wang et al. constructed a new index, the D<sub>Div</sub> index, to identify interdisciplinary breakthrough innovation effectively [6]. Liu et al. using a combinatorial approach and a pre-trained Bio-BERT model to quantify the scientific novelty of doctoral theses based on bio-entities [3]. Zhang et al. explored the relationship between team institutional composition and novelty in academic papers [1]. Zhang et al. proposed a context-enhanced transformer for extracting problem and method sentences from scientific papers [8]. Meanwhile, Wang et al. explored academic influence of algorithms by co-occurrence network based on full-text of academic papers [4]. Lu et al. introduce the INTEGrity vERification (INTEGER) task to help researchers in assessing the integrity of their papers by verifying the clarity of each knowledge unit. Identifying the main factors of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution provides a broader perspective on measuring the innovative nature of science. Therefore, we propose this workshop to gather researchers and practical users to initiate a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue.

	    <i><b>Abstract</b></i>
	    : Team becomes the fundamental unit to create innovation. How to form an effective team is the question that everyone deeply cares, whether you are a leader of a multinational company or a student from a local community college. This talk unveils the insights of a comprehensive study of several millions of teams from different academic fields about their team formation and team performance. It highlights the understanding of teams from the perspectives of team power, shared leadership, and diversity. Flat team structure, heterogeneous shared leadership, and rich diversity are different pathways for team success.
